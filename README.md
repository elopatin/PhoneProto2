PhoneProto2
===========

A medical mobile application prototype for iPhone.

This project was built for a client to showcase a series of proposed features in a medical mobile application. Using Flex it was possible to rapidly iterate through design changes, build in interactivity to a desired level, and overall provide a guided experience for the individuals the client intended to share it with.

A sister prototype was also created for use on iPad. See: https://github.com/elopatin/iPadPrototypeSim
